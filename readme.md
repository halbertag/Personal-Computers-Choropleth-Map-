Personal Computers, per 100 people (2002)
=============

## Introduction
This choropleth map showcases the ratio of personal computers to people across a global scale. This map helps the reader understand which countries have more access to technology with a unique dataset.

## Major functions
You can hover over each country, and click on them to make them the center of the screen. The data amount is also displayed whenever the country is hovered over.
I chose the Blue/Purple color scheme because it gave a calming vibe to the map.

## Libraries and Data Sources
Leaflet is used as the basemap and I used [Data Hub](https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries) for the country polygons. I did have to go through all the polygons to edit them so that only the countries that I had data for were highlighted. The data is from [Human Progress](https://www.humanprogress.org/dataset/personal-computers/) and I chose the year 2002 to focus on the year with the most countries represented in the dataset.
